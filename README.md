# FuzzyCluster
A python algorithm which uses fuzzy logic to cluster database entries.

This repository represents my work on an algorithm to quickly cluster arrays of records by their similarity. It offers a high
  degree of configurability by the end user with respect to what array elements matter more for the comparison. This system is
  still new and it under development but this publication marks the beginning of the optimization process to bring the time
  complexity of the algorithm back down to Earth. I am excited to see what can be made of this project.


Respectfully,
Austin Dial
